### Show notes

- Australia is still on fire. [Just less so](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/massive-relief-torrential-rain-douses-bushfires-across-parts-of-australia), and now there's [floods](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-09/life-threatening-nsw-flood-warnings-power-out-for-thousands/11947268).
- Bridget McKenzie has [resigned from cabinet](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/02/bridget-mckenzie-resigns-following-sports-rort-affair), which is pretty meaningless. She's still got her seat, paycheque and pension.
- Peter Dutton is [blaming the fires on arson](https://twitter.com/joshgnosis/status/1224927542416592897), not climate change, in an return to form for the Australian government. Tom McLean gave them until May [in Episode 2](/002-clean-coal-and-other-fairytales/), but was far too generous.
- Keep fascists [out of Coburg](https://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/?p=39934)
- [The Million Flag Patriots](https://newmatilda.com/2018/10/31/punching-patriots-tackle-gavin-mcinnes-proud-boys-promise-violence-australia/): ridiculing fascists by agreeing too hard.
- [Yelling at Racist Dogs](https://thebrag.com/from-the-frontlines-to-the-fringe-the-rise-of-yelling-at-racist-dogs/): does what it says on the tin.
- The [activist blockade of the IMARC mining conference](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/protesters-clash-with-police-outside-melbourne-mining-conference/11648540) in Melbourne were met with brutal police tactics.
- Melbourne Activist Legal Observers [wrote a damning report](https://melbourneactivistlegalsupport.org/2019/12/06/report-the-policing-of-the-imarc-protests/) of Victoria Police's conduct.  
- Victoria Police's public order response team has [some cool gear](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/public-order-response-team-20170325-gv6cc1.html) I guess
- Travis Gray, the [alt-right cop](https://twitter.com/tom_tanuki/status/1190185931166236672)
- Ted Kazinski, [ecoterrorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski#Industrial_Society_and_Its_Future), palatable to eco-fascists.
- Billionares are getting ready to [hide out in New Zealand](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/15/why-silicon-valley-billionaires-are-prepping-for-the-apocalypse-in-new-zealand) when the world they are destroying collapses.

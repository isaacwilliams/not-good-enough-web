- Since the [Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_Aboriginal_Deaths_in_Custody) in 1991, there have been [400 deaths of Aboriginal people while in police custody](https://www.mamamia.com.au/aboriginal-deaths-in-custody/), with no police being held responsible.
- [Rio Tinto blew up Juukan Gorge cave](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine), a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal sacred site.
- Scott Morrison [invoked the Indigenous principle of caring for country](https://www.msn.com/en-au/video/sport/caring-for-country-pm-outlines-jobmaker-principles/vp-BB14AGgr) to justify policies of austerity.

### Robodebt, dead

- [The government has scrapped Robodebt](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-29/federal-government-refund-robodebt-scheme-repay-debts/12299410), the illegal policy of hounding people for debts they don't owe.

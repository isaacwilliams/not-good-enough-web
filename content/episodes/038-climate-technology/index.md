## Ghost of climate past

- Scott Morrison brought a [piece of coal into parliament in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea5bOaPkZpc).
- The piece of coal was lacquered, and [given to him by a Minerals Council lobbyist](https://reneweconomy.com.au/lobbyist-who-provided-morrisons-lump-of-coal-joins-pms-advisory-team-93806/).
- Scott Morrison came to power [after rolling Scott Morrison](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/20/liberal-party-self-destructing-national-energy-guarantee-malcolm-turnbull-what-you-need-to-know) over [the National Energy Guarantee](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-will-australias-prime-minister-accept-the-reality-of-the-climate-crisis).
- The Morrison government pushed for using "roll-over credits" to [avoid action on climate change](https://theconversation.com/carry-over-credits-and-carbon-offsets-are-hot-topics-this-election-but-what-do-they-actually-mean-116748).
- [100 countries challenged Australia on this approach](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/09/about-100-countries-at-un-climate-talks-challenge-australias-use-of-carryover-credits), and the [UN accused us of cheating](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/16/un-climate-talks-australia-accused-of-cheating-and-thwarting-global-deal). 
- Angus Taylor and the Morrison government have been [trying to use the Clean Energy Corporation to fund gas projects, by re-classifying gas as green energy](https://reneweconomy.com.au/grid-reliability-fund-finally-makes-it-to-parliament-to-push-cefc-into-gas-14529/).
- The "Covid Recovery Commission" is [packed with gas lobbyists, and keep recommending gas projects as a path to recovery](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/coalitions-gas-plan-would-help-fewer-than-1-of-manufacturing-workers-report-finds).  

## Ghost of climate present

- The Morrison government's new [Climate technology roadmap is bad](https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/September%202020/document/first-low-emissions-technology-statement-2020.pdf).
- Australia [exports a lot of coal](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/19/australia-is-third-largest-exporter-of-fossil-fuels-behind-russia-and-saudi-arabia), but it [doesn't actually make us that much money](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2019/sep/the-changing-global-market-for-australian-coal.html).
- Hydrogen isn't an energy source. [It's way to store and transport energy — eg. coal and gas](https://reneweconomy.com.au/taylors-technology-roadmap-likely-to-be-a-boost-for-not-so-green-hydrogen-78011/).
- The best way to [produce low-carbon aluminium or steel is to use renewable energy](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/heres-how-aluminium-can-help-to-build-a-green-recovery/).
- [Carbon capture and storage is grift](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-09-19/angus-taylor-carbon-capture-storage-gorgon-chevron/12676732). We've talked [about the failed Gorgon Gas plant before in episode 25](https://notgoodpod.com/025-nationalise-it/).
- [Kiss the Ground](https://kissthegroundmovie.com/), a documentary about regenerative agriculture.
- Nothing in the climate roadmap [explains why these technologies were chosen](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/23/by-2020-standards-angus-taylors-low-emissions-technology-statement-is-not-really-a-climate-policy).
- The roadmap [isn't based on any independent studies — it's departmental and industry group guesses](https://reneweconomy.com.au/taylor-favours-fossil-fuels-and-farmers-as-roadmap-picks-five-technology-winners-33361/).
- The government [has threatened to build new gas plants with public money](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-14/government-unveils-gas-fired-coronavirus-recovery-plan/12663214), if the free market won't fund it.
- Malcolm Turnbull [kept money in Cayman Island accounts](https://www.afr.com/politics/malcolm-turnbull-named-in-panama-papers-20160511-gosvit).

## Ghost of climate future

- After last year's disastrous bushfire season, [Australia is still woefully underprepared for another one](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-22/royal-commission-told-australia-not-ready-for-natural-disasters/12690270).
- [Mitch on The Drum in 2019](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/the-drum:-thursday-december-19/11818062?nw=0).
- Sydney's gas [network is constantly leaking methane](https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/sydney-awash-with-leaks-as-research-shows-the-climate-cost-of-gas-20200828-p55qd5.html). You can't lie to the atmosphere.

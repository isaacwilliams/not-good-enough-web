## NSW Has the Roni

- NSW's [Northern Beaches is under lockdown](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-20/sydney-northern-beaches-enters-day-one-of-coronavirus-lockdown/13000648).
- Seems likely the failures the [quarantine requirements are to blame for the outbreak](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-19/northern-beaches-covid-gaps-in-hotel-quarantine-system/12997972).

## Saving Djab Wurrung

- The Federal Court has ruled that the [Victorian Government's decision to build a highway through Djab Wurrung birthing trees was made incorrectly](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-17/federal-court-overturns-sussan-leys-decision-on-sacred-trees/12970540), and must be re-judged by someone who isn't Sussan Ley.
- In the same highway project [in 2015, in a "planning blunder" led to the destruction of 900 native trees](https://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/nine-hundred-giant-native-trees-felled-in-vicroads-planning-blunder-20150804-gir5jn.html).

## Cop tower redux

- The [Victorian Ombudsman's report into the public tower lockdowns](https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/file_uploads/Victorian_Ombudsman_report_-_Investigation_into_the_detention_and_treatment_of_public_housing_residents_arising_from_a_COVID-19__hard_lockdown__in_July_2020_qr4jV2bK.pdf) (PDF link) has been released.

- Like [the hotel quarantine report](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/blacked-out-emails-show-dispute-over-security-company-s-role-20201029-p569uz.html), we probably won't know who was responsible for these decisions.

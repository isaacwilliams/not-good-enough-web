## Anzac Biscuit Day

*   Anzac day is becoming [increasingly iffy](https://theconversation.com/the-anzac-legend-has-blinded-australia-to-its-war-atrocities-its-time-for-a-reckoning-151022), and [the kids just aren’t feeling it any more.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/22/crowds-at-anzac-day-dawn-services-plummet-due-to-waning-interest-of-younger-australians?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=soc_568&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1619080156)
*   The government loves to pay lip service to the troops, and then turn around and do things like [lend money to veterans using their pensions as collateral, and then not restore the pension after they pay it back](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-30/defence-force-retirement-benefits-shortfall-veterans-action/10760352). 
*   [This is the inside of Evie’s mind on Anzac day. ](https://www.deviantart.com/famousmari5/art/World-War-I-Super-Mario-ANZAC-676733804)
*   Did we mention Ben Roberts Smith won [Father of the year back in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Father_of_the_Year_award)? ALLEGED sorry ALLEGED father of the year.


## I non-consensually drink your milkshake

*   The government tried to make an education program about consent without using the word “consent”, [which went predictably poorly. ](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-20/nsw-premier-state-politicians-slam-milkshake-consent-video/100081296)
*   Alan Tudge, the relevant Minister, has so far [not gone to jail for anything](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/23/coalition-minister-alan-tudge-engaged-in-criminal-conduct-over-detention-of-afghan-asylum-seeker-judge), and is newsworthy for a variety of reasons, [including alleged bullying.](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/very-humiliating-alan-tudge-s-staffer-says-he-was-a-bully-who-left-her-in-tears-20201110-p56db3.html)
*   The Safe Schools program, which tackled LGBTIQ+ issues and other important topics of sexuality and identity, [outraged conservatives](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/24/victorian-opposition-vows-to-scrap-safe-schools-and-teach-western-principles) and was ended in most areas except for Victoria.
*   Scott Morrison apparently hated existing sex education programs so much that [he sent his daughters to a private school](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/03/scott-morrison-sends-his-children-to-private-school-to-avoid-skin-curling-sexuality-discussions).


## Happy Corporate Greenwashing Day

*   It was Earth Day on the 22nd of April, which [was originally started among the civil rights movement in the 60s.](https://grist.org/politics/its-time-for-civil-rights-and-environmental-activists-to-join-hands/)
*   Environmental Journalists like Emily Atkin from Heated can tell you about [the corporate greenwashing festival this day has become.](https://heated.world/p/my-earth-day-inbox)
*   [Scott Morrison thoroughly embarrassed the nation](https://reneweconomy.com.au/morrison-finds-shameless-new-way-to-fake-climate-action-as-world-steps-up/) at the Climate Leaders Summit, with a classic combination of incompetence, spin, and lies.
*   Even fluffy morning TV show host (and alleged father of the year) [Kochy called Angus Taylor on our pathetic climate targets.](https://reneweconomy.com.au/no-australia-isnt-beating-other-countries-on-climate/)


## Kristina Kerscher Keneally’s Kaptive Kid Korner

*   The notorious KKK visited the Tamil Asylum seeker family that was deported from their loving community in Biloela. They’re currently being held indefinitely on Christmas Island.
*   [She wrote about her experiences](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/21/i-saw-first-hand-the-terrible-toll-detention-is-taking-on-the-biloela-family), but be warned, this is coming directly from a politician whose party was instrumental in the laws that have resulted in this family being detained.
*   [It’s easy to check her personal voting record.](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/senate/nsw/kristina_keneally) 
*   She’s previously ~~dog~~written on how [migrants will take our jobs.](https://www.smh.com.au/national/do-we-want-migrants-to-return-in-the-same-numbers-the-answer-is-no-20200501-p54p2q.html)

## Lockdown again again

- A limo driver at the center of the Sydney outbreak was [eligible for the vaccine](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/25/sydney-limo-driver-police-seek-urgent-legal-advice-if-bondi-limousine-breached-covid-orders), but didn't get one because he was afraid to. Police [are trying to pin something on him](https://mobile.twitter.com/davidlipson/status/1408236526677282818).
- Gladys Berejiklian [admits to pork-barrelling](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/26/berejiklian-admits-140m-grant-scheme-was-pork-barrelling-as-approval-documents-revealed).
- Richard Pusey [filmed dying police officers](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2021/june/1622469600/sarah-krasnostein/most-hated-man).
- Prime Minster Scott Morrison [says the outbreak is NSW's fault](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/don-t-blame-me-for-sydney-cluster-it-s-nsw-s-problem-pm-20210624-p583x2).

## Ssussann Ley

- Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley [added an extra "s" to her name](https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/why-sussan-ley-has-an-extra-s-in-her-name/news-story/4c2bb14f934012a810d2001682e2cc42) because of a misunderstanding of numerology. Maybe just so she could [add an extra cool S](https://twitter.com/mattDCLXVI/status/1406948641902718983)?
- Check out episode [74: Care of Duty: Modern Lawfare](https://notgoodpod.com/074-care-of-duty-modern-lawfare/).
- Sussan Ley vetoed a massive new [renewable energy hub, quoting "environmental impacts"](https://reneweconomy.com.au/clearly-unacceptable-morrison-government-blocks-massive-pilbara-renewable-hydrogen-hub/).
- ...while approving 21 offshore [gas drilling sites near Victoria's Twelve Apostles](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/canberra-opens-bids-for-gas-oil-drilling-near-twelve-apostles-20210615-p5819t.html).
- She also put the solar power industry "on notice", [saying they need to sort out recycling](https://reneweconomy.com.au/solar-industry-put-on-notice-for-landfill-nightmare-by-federal-environment-minister/).
- Australia has [very little actual recycling infrastructure](https://theconversation.com/australias-waste-export-ban-becomes-law-but-the-crisis-is-far-from-over-151675).
- Ley is also considering allowing a [banned poison to deal with NSW's mouse plague](https://twitter.com/BirdlifeOz/status/1405813035822895106).
- She was "blindsided" by UNESCO recommending that [the Great Barrier Reef be placed on a list as in "great danger"](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-22/environment-minister-great-barrier-reef-listed-in-danger/100233088).
- Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson forced the Audit Office to admit [that the Government's $444 million grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-16/great-barrier-reef-funding-grant-scrutinised-auditor-general/10720928) was to [avoid the very same UNESCO listing](https://twitter.com/SenatorSurfer/status/1407135961377501187).

## Three large sons

- Australia has entered a new military [pact with the US & UK to build a couple of new submarines](https://www.crikey.com.au/2021/09/17/aukus-another-morrison-masterclass-big-announcements-poor-management-dud-deals/). It's [pronounced "Orcus"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orcus).
- We wasted [billions of dollars on the Collins class Submarines](https://www.smh.com.au/national/wa-to-miss-out-on-8-4-billion-as-feds-pick-south-australia-for-submarine-maintenance-20210916-p58s75.html).
- No one [remembers Scott Morrison's name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYVGtAWDW7I).
- Scott Morrison called French President Macron the [night before the contract was announced](https://www.9news.com.au/national/more-us-troops-to-be-based-in-northern-australia-defence-minister-says/e8eba409-8ab7-497c-8ccf-044e5c2dc0c2). [They're pissed now](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/17/france-recalls-ambassadors-to-us-and-australia-after-aukus-pact).
- France is a [major provider of military contracts in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Australia).
- Nationals MP Matt Canavan is already [trying to pivot this into a push for nuclear power](https://twitter.com/mattjcan/status/1438675775373275136).
- The move has also pissed off Indonesia, who [canceled a planned visit between President Widodo and Scott Morrison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5MZoRlqZrE).
- Australia's [very clever defense policy](https://twitter.com/workingdogprod/status/902855541143117825).
- Greens leader Adam Bandt [called the submarines "floating Chernobyls"](https://twitter.com/adambandt/status/1438276985566814209).
- **Correction:** Lang states that Matt Damon was in Pearl Harbor. This is a common mistake; he was thinking of Jon Voight.

## Top of the cops

- Police shut down [Melbourne's public transport to put a damper on anti-lockdown protests](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/drive/victoria-police-suspend-melbournes-public-transport-system-ahead/13543720).
- The [protests still happened](https://twitter.com/davidestcourt/status/1439070855418368000).
- Construction workers also [protested the shutting down of tea rooms](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/melbourne-tradies-protest-virus-tea-room-closures-at-construction-sites/news-story/a3bc7d5d1d1e89cf1546ce0544842800).

## Shoutouts

- Shoutouts to Joel Fitzgibbon, who is not recontesting the next election in Hunter, but has been highly effective at saying the quiet part loud.

## Pinkwashing

- The Melbourne Queer Film Festival [were asked to drop a pink-washing Israli film](https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvg3j/israel-pinkwashing-melbourne-queer-film-festival), and join in BDS against the aparthied state.
- They didn't, saying they [wanted to remain "apolitical"](https://mqff.com.au/media-statement-response-to-the-screening-of-an-israeli-film/).
- The push to remove the film was [spearheaded by Queer Palestinians like Lujayn Hourani](https://www.3cr.org.au/inyaface/episode-202111191600/lujayn-hourani-pinkwashing-and-melbourne-queer-film-festival-simona).
- MQFF co-president Molly Whelan and board member Nayuka Gorrie [have resigned over the festival's decision](https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/melbourne-queer-film-festival-the-swimmer-palestine-israel-pinkwashing/).

## Returning hero

- Former North Melbourne coach Dani Laidley returned to speak at the football club, [representing her "old tribe and new tribe"](https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/my-old-tribe-and-my-new-dani-laidley-s-debt-to-her-north-teammates-and-the-club-s-to-her-20211118-p59a38.html).

## Pride lobby

- The Victorian Pride lobby [surveyed 1,500 LGBTIQA+ people to understand their feelings towards police](https://www.vicpridelobby.org/download/upholding-our-rights-lgbtiqa-attitudes-towards-and-experiences-with-police/).
- In 2019, [police raided queer bookshop Hares & Hyenas, breaking a man's arm](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/law-crime/2019/05/18/police-raid-hares-hyenas-building/15581016008157) (they also had the wrong address).
- IBAC [found it was okay though](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-17/high-distrust-of-law-enforcement-in-lgbtiq-communities/13635376).

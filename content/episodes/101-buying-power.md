## Power flop

- [Powershop got acquired by Shell](https://www.smh.com.au/national/shell-takeover-of-powershop-infuriates-green-consumers-20211124-p59bp9.html).
- Energy Australia [cancelled their partnership with Powershop](https://reneweconomy.com.au/shell-seeks-to-calm-fears-as-some-powershop-customers-look-elsewhere-after-acquisition/).
- [Amber Electric got sassy](https://www.amber.com.au/blog/in-loving-memory-of-powershop).
- Shell have said they [plan to reach "net zero" by 2050](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/05/18/shells-net-zero-plan-will-judged-science-not-spin/).

## Opposition party?

- The Labor party have [announced a plan to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/03/anthony-albanese-commits-labor-to-emissions-reduction-target-of-43-by-2030) if they are elected. Such ambition!
- They've also [dumped plans for vehicle emissions standards](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/federal/labor-to-dump-fuel-emissions-plan-in-next-step-on-climate-20211130-p59dkj.html).
- And worked with the government to [hand out more subsidies to gas miners](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7521820/greens-bid-to-block-beetaloo-gas-grants-doomed-to-fail/).
- Oh also they worked with the [LNP to stifle criticism from charities](https://twitter.com/ebony_bennett/status/1465901989766656002).

## Actions

- [Change your energy provider again](https://www.energymadeeasy.gov.au). Sorry. Hopefully it'll work out next time! Check out [Co Power](https://www.cooperativepower.org.au/) or [Amber Electric](https://www.amber.com.au/).

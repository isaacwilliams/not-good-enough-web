## Fucking around / finding out

- The second part of [the 6th IPCC report has been released](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/). This one is about the social cost of climate change.
- UN President António Guterres: ["I've seen many reports, but nothing like the new IPCC climate report, an atlas of human suffering"](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1498256378506448899).
- The government response: [Ignoring it](https://reneweconomy.com.au/morrisons-deathly-silence-on-ipcc-report-as-floods-devastate-east-coast/).
- Except for Pauline Hanson, who's [happily denying that climate change exists](https://twitter.com/TheKennyDevine/status/1498234673440313345).
- On a plus side, Victoria has announced a [massive new offshore wind project to replace our aging coal plants](https://reneweconomy.com.au/victoria-sets-game-changing-offshore-wind-target-of-9gw-to-replace-coal/).

## Floodcast (not that one)

- The government has $5 billion [sitting in a federal disaster fund, and just isn't spending it](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-02/why-money-in-5-billion-disaster-fund-barely-being-spent/100875674).
- With local media closing, the ABC running on a rapidly shrinking shoestring budget, [people are stuck without news that talks to them](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/27/abc-says-it-cannot-fill-void-created-by-closure-of-suburban-and-regional-newspapers).
- But it's okay, [Peter Dutton has started a GoFundMe to help out](https://www.gofundme.com/f/pine-rivers-flood-relief).

I have never seen so many natural disasters"](https://7news.com.au/weather/natural-disasters/flood-grants-as-qld-faces-climate-reality-c-5927781), but followed with... "Queensland is lucky, we have coal, we have gas".
- Shane Stone, head of Australia's disaster relief agency, [vacillates on climate change](https://twitter.com/matthewbevan/status/1204140388472111104), and [blames residents for wanting to "live amongst the gum trees"](https://junkee.com/shane-stone-disaster-recovery-flood-comments/323425).

## Adelaidepilled

- The election in South Australia saw large swings against the Liberals. The [new Premier said some okay things](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-19/who-is-sa-premier-peter-malinauskas/100924176).

## Fair enough!

- The federal court has found that the Environment Minister [doesn't have a duty of care to protect children from climate change after all](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/sussan-ley-does-not-have-duty-of-care-to-protect-young-from-climate-crisis-appeal-court-rules)!
- The judges had a lot of [good legal reasons why we should ignore the fact that the government has blood on it's hands](https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/hub/media/tearout-excerpt/6084/Judgment-summary---VID389.2021-(002).pdf).
- Climate change-lover Joel Fitzgibbon [loves this](https://twitter.com/fitzhunter/status/1503587053556334594).
- Climate scientist [Peter Kalmus on the need to take risks](https://mobile.twitter.com/ClimateHuman/status/1502911339433377796).

## A harder place to live

- Scott Morrison [says Australia is becoming a harder place to live](https://twitter.com/TheTodayShow/status/1502758814352920583). I wonder who did that?
- Guess he's just [moving through the stages of climate change denial](https://climatecrocks.com/2017/08/04/katharine-hayhoe-the-five-stages-of-climate-denial/).
- Scotty also reckons we [should run coal power plants for as long as possible](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/scott-morrison-says-coal-power-stations-should-run-as-long-as-they-possibly-can)!
